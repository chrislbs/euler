     * A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be
     * necessary to employ "guess and test" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion
     * over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is
     * considered easy because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.
     * The 6K text file, sudoku.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles
     * ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).
     * By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution
     * grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.
     * @param args
